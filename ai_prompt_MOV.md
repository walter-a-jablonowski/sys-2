
Please read the prompt in ai.md and make a new improved prompt from it in ai_improved.md without loosing any requirements from the original prompt. Make sure that the new system works as intended by the original prompt and has all of its features.

If you find problems in the original prompt (e.g. feature gaps, logical problems or something else), please fix the problems in the new prompt so that the overall system most likely will work as intended.

Don't add unnecessary features that aren't in the original prompt, except if you need that to fix problems.
